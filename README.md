# Infographics

In the first year of BTech, we had many assignments involving infographics as a part of, or as a final submission. Some of them were group work. Here, I am putting some of my contribution.

#### Calculus:
() This group assignment was about any application involving formulas of calculus. We chose Weather prediction as our domain and focused upon Horizontal Momentum Equation, meauring a flow of wing. Final submission was in a form of class presentation of the infographic pasted here. I contributed in designing as well as collecting information about basics of weather.

#### Data Science:
In the course of Data Science, we had an assignment of making a detailed info-graph. We, the group of three, divided total number of submissions among ourselves, and prepared an individual charts. We suggested changes to each other. And, these two are which I prepared. 

##### (1) Rurar Urban Distribution
&emsp; It was my choice to decide a subject. I made my mind to go with this challenging subject. At the beginning I learnt an overview of the domaina and listed out official sources from where I could get figures for the graph, along with few of the topics only I need to work upon. I collected the numeric data as an excel file, read the discription from the reports and presentations published by census of India - 2011, and formed a narrative. The final part was of designing. 

##### (2) Climate Change
&emsp; I got more formal understanding of this outspoken issue. Not containing too much numbers, I made it simple to understand the issue as a whole. I pasted plentiful images and graphics instead of lines of text. Easy to read, this graphics may be used for a primary level students.

#### Neighbourhood:
(The picture story) In the foundation studio about Neighborhood, we had an individual Assinment where we had to depict idea of neighbourhood in a comic form.
